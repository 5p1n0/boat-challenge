# Boat Challenge

## Concept

   My goal is to recreate the boat picture with randomly generated iceberg shapes and with a boat capable of moving with keyboard controls.
   
   Here's my progress so far:
    
   - [x] Raw iceberg animation
   - [x] Fill the sea with icebergs 
   - [x] Boat shape
   - [x] Boat movements
   - [x] Code cleanup
