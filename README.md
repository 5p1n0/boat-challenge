# Boat Challenge

## Concept

   My goal is to recreate the boat picture with randomly generated iceberg shapes and with a boat capable of moving with keyboard controls.
   
   Here's my progress so far:
    
   - [x] Raw iceberg animation
   - [x] Randomly generate iceberg shapes
   - [ ] Fill the sea with icebergs 
   - [ ] Boat shape
   - [ ] Boat movements
   - [ ] Code cleanup
